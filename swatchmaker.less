//this file is intended to be copied into the swatch directory and then compiled using lessc . See make-bootswatches.sh for more.
//be careful to comment out either bootstrap.less or bootstrap-customize. you cant have both or will wind up with unpredictable results.
//bootstrap-customize.less is just a copy of bootstrap.less but with components you dont want commented out.

// add @import statements (which dont work with namespaces) in this file for things like fonts,etc.
@import "cssimports.less";
